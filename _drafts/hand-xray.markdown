  A brief overview of hand anatomy, explained via a recent X-ray that I got.
---

I recently got into a bike accident and was worried that I might have fractured my hand (according to my wife, the way that I fell and the injury location was in line with the classic board exam description of a [Colles' fracture][colles-fracture]). Fortunately, the X-ray came back negative, but it was the first time I've actually gotten to see my own hand bones. My wife has also mentioned to me that hand anatomy is one of the most complicated things to memorize in medical school, which I found interesting having worked in robotics because grasping robots tend to be quite simple.

To rectify this apparent disparity, I figured it would be a good opportunity to write an overview of hand anatomy using my own X-rays as a reference, reviewed by my wife. Hopefully this will be useful to roboticists working on grasping and manipulation.
