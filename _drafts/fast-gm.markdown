excerpt: Describing a framework for optimizing graphical model algorithms in CUDA
math: true

In past posts, I described some optimizations for the [logsumexp function][logsumexp-post], as well as some tricks for writing [CUDA extensions][cuda-post] for PyTorch. In this post, I'll describe a framework I've been working on for accelerated inference on certain graphical models.
