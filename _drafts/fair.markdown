excerpt: Reflections on my time at Facebook and doing AI research
---

This week I wrapped up my last week at Facebook, after two years and nine months. When I left, I had been there longer than at least two thirds of employees, which speaks to how fast Facebook has been growing since I started. As my first job out of college, working at Facebook will probably always hold a special place in my heart, and I have a lot of fond memories of getting to work on really cool problems with super smart people. But I thought it would be a good idea to write up something about my experience there, for other people who might be interested in pursing a machine learning career at Facebook or elsewhere.

## The Beginning

I never really thought I would end up working for Facebook. I'm not a particularly active Facebook user (my wife doesn't even have a Facebook account). When I was in college working in a neuroscience research lab, before I had thought working at some Silicon Valley company would be in my future, most people I knew thought the coolest company to work for would be Google, but they were super competitive and only employed the best of the best.
