  Part two of a series of thoughts about humanoid robots.

In conversations with intelligent people about how to launch a humanoid robot company, it has been suggested to me that I follow the Tesla model. Essentially, the idea is that if you first make a really great product that appeals to a niche market of high-end buyers, like the Tesla Roadster, you can then expand into the rest of the market as you increase production and lower costs, as with the Tesla Model S and subsequently the Model 3. Some other products from other companies which have followed this model are the iPhone, the Oculus Rift, the Dyson vacuum, and the Peloton bike.

The reasoning for this is pretty easy to follow. You should make a great product with high margins before you've figured out how to bring costs down, because if you don't, you'll make a bad product with low margins and your company will die.

With regards to humanoid robots, this thinking is also basically wrong.
