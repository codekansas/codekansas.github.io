This post is a reference for the different types of gears that might be relevant for robotics applications.

## Change Gearing Ratio

<details>
<summary>Spur</summary>
<div>
<p>A cylindrical gear with straight teeth that run parallel to the axis of rotation.</p>

<summary>Helical</summary>
<div>
<p>A cylindrical gear with angled teeth that form a helix shape around the gear.</p>

### Internal Gear

<details>
<summary>Planetary</summary>
<div>
<p>A gear system in which multiple gears rotate around a central sun gear to transmit power and torque.</p>
<p>Gearing ratios for planetary gears typically max out around 10:1.</p>

<summary>Harmonic Drive / Strain Wave Generator</summary>
<div>
<p>A harmonic drive is a type of gear system that uses an elliptical flexure to transfer motion between a wave generator and a flexible cup. It offers high gear ratios, high accuracy, and zero backlash, making it useful in applications where precision is important.</p>
<p>The gearing ratio for a harmonic drive can be expressed as <code>r = E / (C - E)</code> where <code>E</code> is the number of teeth on the (outer) circular ring gear and <code>C</code> is the number of teeth on the (inner) elliptical gear.</p>
<p>For example, a gear with 50 outer teeth and 52 inner teeth would have a gearing ratio of <code>50 / (52 - 50) = 50 / 2 = 25</code>.</p>
<p>Note that the inner axel spins slower than the outer axel.</p>

<summary>Cycloidal Drive</summary>
<div>
<p>A cycloidal drive uses an eccentrically mounted cycloidal disc to transfer motion between a input shaft and a rotating output shaft. It offers high torque capacity and low noise, making it useful in industrial machinery.</p>
<p>The gearing ratio for a cycloidal drive can be expressed as <code>r = L / (P - L)</code> where <code>P</code> is the number of (outer) ring pins and <code>L</code> is the number of (inner) roller pins.</p>
<p>For example, a gear with 10 outer pins and 9 inner pins would have a gearing ratio of <code>9 / (10 - 9) = 9</code>.</p>
<p>Note that the inner axel spins slower than the outer axel.</p>

## Change Direction

<details>
<summary>Bevel</summary>
<div>
<p>A gear with angled teeth that intersect at a point and used to transfer motion between non-parallel shafts.</p>

### Right Angle

<details>
<summary>Worm</summary>
<div>
<p>A gear with a screw-like shape that meshes with a helical gear and is used to transfer motion at a right angle. These are usually used for high torque applications because they have a big gearing ratio.</p>

<details>
<summary>Miter</summary>
<div>
<p>A type of bevel gear that is designed to transfer power between two shafts that are at a right angle to each other.</p>
<figure>
    <img src='/images/gears/miter.webp' />
    <figcaption>A miter gear.</figcaption>

<details>
<summary>Hypoid</summary>
<div>
<p>A bevel gear with non-intersecting axes and an offset between the shafts.</p>
<figure>

    <figcaption>A hypoid gear.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

### Rotational to Linear

<details>
<summary>Rack and Pinion</summary>
<div>
<p>A gear in which a flat bar (the rack) meshes with a gear (the pinion) to convert rotational motion into linear motion.</p>
