excerpt: Short post about what I've been up to lately.
---

I was looking at my blog a few days ago and realized that it's been a while since I've written anything, so I figured it would be good to give a short summary of what I've been up to lately (partially so that I can remember if someone presses me on it in a few years).

I left Facebook in February to start a job with Tesla, which meant moving from Nashville to Mountain View, California. The weather is a lot nicer here, although I miss the Nashville climbing gym and not having to pay an arm and a leg for rent every month. Tesla has been pretty fast-paced. It's different from Facebook in a lot of ways, some good and some bad. All around, though, I'm glad I made the move.

My wife is in the process of applying to her medical residency, so depending on how that goes we might end up somewhere totally different, like Nebraska, although I'm hoping this won't happen (it's more of a last resort right now).

The Coronavirus pandemic still sucks, but at least the Bay Area is doing a reasonable job of controlling it. I flew to New York for a few days last weekend, and a lot of the museums were open if you presented your vaccine card. Still, it's hard to travel internationally, and I'm looking forward to it calming down more.

I'm playing a lot more soccer than I was in Nashville, and biking to work most days, although my sleep schedule could use some improvement.

Anyway, if you're my future child and you're reading this right now, your mother wanted to name you after a makeup brand. Hopefully I didn't let her and you're named after a tech CEO instead. Also I'll transfer you some Bitcoin so you can buy lunch at school.
