[Philip Larkin, _Aubade_](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/48422/aubade-56d229a6e2f07)

Like many people working in AI, I am a big fan of the movie _Ex Machina_, starring Alicia Vikander, Domhnall Gleeson, and Oscar Isaac. It's probably my all-time favorite movie. Alex Garland, the writer and director, has been involved in a number of other sci-fi movies that I've enjoyed, such as _28 Days Later_, _Sunshine_, and _Annihilation_. So when I heard that he was creating a TV mini-series called _Devs_, I was very excited. I finally got around to watching it, and I wanted to write down my thoughts on it.

Obviously I am not a movie critic, so my thoughts on the cinematic aspects will probably fall short. I'm also not an expert on quantum computing or the philosophy of determinism verses free will, so my perspective on that is limited to a somewhat-mathematically-oriented observer. However, having spent some time in Silicon Valley and the tech industry, the show resonated with me on a level that I wasn't expecting.

## Cinematic Aspects

Like _Ex Machina_, _Devs_ is cinematically beautiful. I think Alex Garland should design tech campuses instead of the Disney World guys that everyone seems to contract with. The Amaya campus (the shadowy quantum computer company that the smart Bay Area techies bus down to every day) is in the middle of a redwood forest, and the natural scenery plays a big role in setting the mood of the show.

I've had a long-running half-joke with my wife that my ideal place to live would be the compound in _Ex Machina_. I think for people who spend almost every hour of their waking life in front of a computer, surrounding yourself in nature holds a certain appeal. I think this is why Seattle is such a popular destination for tech workers. Similarly, _Devs_ does a great job at contrasting the hyper-technological world of the Amaya campus with the natural beauty of the surrounding forest. It speaks to a sort of longing that I think many people in the tech industry feel, for technology to be a natural extension of our own organic humanity rather than being set opposed to it.

## Determinism verse Free Will

It's been a while since I watched a TV show that really stuck with me, but after I finished _Devs_, I couldn't stop thinking about it for days. The ideas seem plausible enough. I did some light Wikipedia browsing about some of the theories that they mentioned in the show. My initial read on the "determinism verses multiverse" premise is that it doesn't seem to be particularly scientific (it kind of reminds me of the pop Buddhist bro-stuff that gets recommended to me on social media sometimes). However, the show at least does a good job of exploring these ideas without feeling overly expository. _Ex Machina_ is essentially a two hour movie about two people talking, but it never feels boring. Similarly, the pacing of _Devs_ is pretty slow and it involves a lot of talking, but it's done in a way that feels natural and engaging.

There's a scene near the end where one of the characters is asked to demonstrate his belief in the many-worlds interpretation by standing on the edge of a large precipice. The idea is that in some of the worlds they fall off the edge, and in some they don't. In the ones that they don't, they get something they want, while in the ones that they do, they are dead and it doesn't matter.

I've been seeing this broader philosophical idea play out in other forms of media, most top-of-mind being _Everything, Everywhere, All At Once_ and _The Midnight Library_. The broader movement has been termed [metamodernism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamodernism) (in contrast with _postmodernism_ and _post-postmodernism_). I don't have any particularly compelling thoughts on the matter besides thinking that it feels extra acute to people who are terminally online, which by design includes most people in the tech industry.

## Quantum Computers

Quantum computers are automatically cool, although in _Devs_ they do feel like a bit of a magic wand for the purposes of the narrative. I found [this Veritasium video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuvK-od647c) about quantum entanglement to be pretty good at giving a high-level overview of the topic (at least for someone like me). I also watched the [Lex Fridman interview with Alex Garland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU-mkuMU428), in which he also described how he wasn't very technical himself, but liked grasping enough of the ideas to craft a compelling narrative. It reminded me of the way that I as a programmer can "playing with numbers" to see what new thing I can create, even though I wouldn't consider myself a great mathematician - similarly, someone like him might "play with ideas" to see where they go, from a creative standpoint.

Anyway, final review: it's a profound show and I highly recommend watching it.
