I've been spinning up on Azure recently and thought it would be good to write some notes about how different components work.

## Azure Technical Support

- Startup Technical Advisors (STAs) are the first line of support for Azure. They are available 24/7 and can be reached through the Azure portal. After logging the request, can reach out to the Azure POC to make sure it gets addressed quickly.
- Azure App Consulting (AAC) is the next level of support. They are experts who provide architecture reviews, migrations or cost optimizations.
- FastTrack engineers are technical experts who help execute on technical project management needs.
- The Founder Hub Support Center can be accessed [here](https://aka.ms/startuphelp)
- Azure product support is available [here](https://portal.azure.com). Check here to debug:
  - Errors or connectivity issues
  - Billing issues
  - Quota requests
